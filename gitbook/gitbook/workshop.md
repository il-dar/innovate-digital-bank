# Introduction

## Kubernetes in Banking

Kubernetes minimize outages and disruptions through self-healing, intelligent scheduling, horizontal scaling, and load balancing. Developers can easily roll out and roll back application versions, whether theyâ€™re collaborating in development and test environments or deploying to production. Even new application functionality is streamlined, when developers extend apps with cloud services. The Result: Spend more time coding and less time with the infrastructure.

Today we will see why kubernetes and microservice is a perfect fit for banking and financial institution. We will see how the financial world was, what microservice and kubernetes promise and as an added bonus we will also see what IBM been doing with IBM open banking platform.
